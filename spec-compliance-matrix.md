# Compliance of Implementations with Specification

The following tables show which features are implemented by each OpenTelemetry
language implementation.

## Legend

### Implementation Status

- `+` means the feature is supported and stable in the language implementation
- `-` means the feature is not supported
- `üß™` means the feature has experimental support in the language implementation
- `N/A` means the feature is not applicable to the particular language
- blank cell means the status of the feature is not known

### Specification Status

- Features marked with `üöß` are experimental in the specification
- Features marked with `‚ö†Ô∏è` are deprecated in the specification
- Features with no symbol are stable in the specification
