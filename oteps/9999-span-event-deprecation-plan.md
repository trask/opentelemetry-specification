# Span Event deprecation plan

## Motivation

As presented in [OTEP 265: Event Vision](0265-event-vision.md),
the long-term plan is to deprecate Span Events in favor of Events.

Since many in the community are relying on Span Events,
this statement has caused concern and worry since there are no further details
in that OTEP about what this deprecation means or how it will be handled.

This OTEP lays out some important details and requirements of that deprecation path.
